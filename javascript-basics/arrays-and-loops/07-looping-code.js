/* for is not the only type of loop available in JavaScript. There are actually many others and, while you don't need to understand all of these now, it is worth having a look at the structure of a couple of others so that you can recognize the same features at work in a slightly different way.

First, let's have a look at the while loop. This loop's syntax looks like so:

initializer
while (condition) {
  // code to run

  final-expression
}

This works in a very similar way to the for loop, except that the initializer variable is set before the loop, and the final-expression is included inside the loop after the code to run, rather than these two items being included inside the parentheses. The condition is included inside the parentheses, which are preceded by the while keyword rather than for.

The same three items are still present, and they are still defined in the same order as they are in the for loop. This is because you must have an initializer defined before you can check whether or not the condition is true. The final-expression is then run after the code inside the loop has run (an iteration has been completed), which will only happen if the condition is still true. */

/* Let's have a look again at our cats list example, but rewritten to use a while loop:

const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

let i = 0;

while (i < cats.length) {
  if (i === cats.length - 1) {
    myFavoriteCats += `and ${cats[i]}.`;
  } else {
    myFavoriteCats += `${cats[i]}, `;
  }

  i++;
}

console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine."

*/

/* The do...while loop is very similar, but provides a variation on the while structure:

initializer
do {
  // code to run

  final-expression
} while (condition)

In this case, the initializer again comes first, before the loop starts. The keyword directly precedes the curly braces containing the code to run and the final expression.

The main difference between a do...while loop and a while loop is that the code inside a do...while loop is always executed at least once. That's because the condition comes after the code inside the loop. So we always run that code, then check to see if we need to run it again. In while and for loops, the check comes first, so the code might never be executed. */

/* Let's rewrite our cat listing example again to use a do...while loop: */

const cats = ["Pete", "Biggles", "Jasmine"];

let myFavoriteCats = "My cats are called ";

let i = 0;

do {
  if (i === cats.length - 1) {
    myFavoriteCats += `and ${cats[i]}.`;
  } else {
    myFavoriteCats += `${cats[i]}, `;
  }

  i++;
} while (i < cats.length);

console.log(myFavoriteCats); // "My cats are called Pete, Biggles, and Jasmine."

/* Warning: With while and do...while — as with all loops — you must make sure that the initializer is incremented or, depending on the case, decremented, so the condition eventually becomes false. If not, the loop will go on forever, and either the browser will force it to stop, or it will crash. This is called an infinite loop. */
